        I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this is just an empty page. Not because
        I'm lazy, but because there's no need for a privacy policy for this
        project. We don't collect any personal data. We don't use cookies. We
        don't track you. We don't even have a server to store your data. We
        don't have any data to store in the first place. We don't have any
        analytics. We don't have any ads. We don't have any third-party
        anything. We don't have any anything. We don't have any legal documents.
        We don't have any documents. We don't have any documents. We don't have
        any documents. We don't have any documents. We don't have any documents.
